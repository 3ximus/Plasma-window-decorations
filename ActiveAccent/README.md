# Active Accent

Simple titlebar-less window decoration that frames the active window in the accent color and the inactive windows in the background color of the current color scheme.

The implementation is due to [@RealezzZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/ri4zko/comment/howapa9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and based on [Breeze Aurorae](https://store.kde.org/p/1461072/).
