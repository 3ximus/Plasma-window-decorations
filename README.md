# Active Accent

Breeze-based window decoration with or without titlebar that frames the active window in the accent color and the inactive windows in the background color of the current color scheme.

The implementation is due to [@RealezzZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/ri4zko/comment/howapa9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and based on [Breeze Aurorae](https://store.kde.org/p/1461072/).
