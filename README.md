# Active Accent window decoration

Breeze-based window decoration with or without titlebar that frames the active window in the accent color and the inactive windows in the background color of the current color scheme.

The theme comes in three versions:

- Active Accent Light: With titlebar for light color schemes
- Active Accent Dark: With titlebar for dark color schemes
- Active Accent Frame: Without titlebar for light and dark color schemes

The core idea of the implementation is due to [@RealezzZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/ri4zko/comment/howapa9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the files are based on [Breeze Aurorae](https://store.kde.org/p/1461072/). The adaption for different styles and packaging is my work.
